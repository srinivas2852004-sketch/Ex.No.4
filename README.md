EXPERIMENT – 4: Scenario-Based Report Development Utilizing Diverse Prompting Techniques- Lab Scenario: Smart Health Assistant System
Register No.: 212222080051
Date: 29.11.2025
Description:
To design an AI-powered chatbot that assists customers in resolving issues related to product troubleshooting, order tracking, and general inquiries. The chatbot should handle various customer queries efficiently while maintaining a conversational and user-friendly tone. In this experiment, we will employ different prompt patterns to guide the development process of the chatbot, ranging from basic task-oriented prompts to more complex, persona-driven prompts. This experiment specifically explores the Smart Health Assistant system named "MediGuide", which supports elderly patients with chronic illnesses such as diabetes, hypertension, and arthritis. The goal is to simulate chatbot behavior using diverse prompting methods across realistic customer service scenarios.

Background:
You are part of a development team creating "MediGuide," an AI-powered assistant for elderly patients. MediGuide helps manage health conditions by delivering medication reminders, personalized advice, daily health tips, and emotional support via natural conversation. Prompts must be optimized to generate context-aware, supportive, and empathetic responses tailored to older users.

Objective:
Develop a scenario-based report that demonstrates how diverse prompting techniques (Experiential Perspective Prompt, Comparative Analysis Prompt, Prompt Size Limitations) can be used to optimize MediGuide’s performance and output in handling typical customer support use cases.

Scenario 1: Smart Thermostat Installation
Prompt Type: Experiential Perspective Prompt Scenario Prompt: "A customer has purchased a smart thermostat and is having trouble setting it up. They contact the chatbot for assistance. The customer says: 'I’ve just received my smart thermostat, but I’m not sure how to install it. Can you help me set it up?'" Prompt: “From the perspective of a technical support agent, how would you assist a customer in setting up a smart thermostat?” Expected Output: “Of course! First, let's ensure your thermostat is properly connected to your Wi-Fi network. Please locate the mounting bracket and connect the wires as per the manual. Once that’s done, turn on the device and follow the on-screen instructions to pair it with the app on your phone. After you’re connected, I’ll guide you through the temperature settings and customization options. If you encounter any issues along the way, don’t hesitate to ask, and I’ll be happy to assist!” Use Case: Personalized, step-by-step support for product setup.

Scenario 2: Order Status Delay
Prompt Type: Comparative Analysis Prompt Scenario Prompt: "A customer is tracking an order they placed for a laptop but has encountered an issue where the tracking page does not show any updates. The customer says: 'I’ve been checking the tracking status for my laptop order, but it hasn’t updated in days. Can you check the status for me?'" Prompt: “Compare how a rule-based chatbot and a machine-learning model would respond to this customer inquiry about an order status update.” Expected Output: “A rule-based chatbot might provide a fixed response such as: ‘Please allow up to 72 hours for shipping updates. For further assistance, contact customer service.’ It is efficient but may not fully address the customer’s concerns. A machine-learning chatbot, however, would likely respond with something like: ‘I understand your frustration. I’ve checked your order status and see that the carrier hasn’t updated the tracking yet. Sometimes delays happen in the system. I’ve escalated this issue to the delivery team, and you’ll receive an update within 24 hours. Thank you for your patience.’” Use Case: Evaluating chatbot adaptability and personalization.

Scenario 3: Contacting Customer Support
Prompt Type: Prompt Size Limitations Scenario Prompt: "A customer has a general inquiry: 'How do I contact customer support if I need help with my order?'" Prompt: “Generate a response in under 150 tokens to a customer asking how they can contact customer support for help with their order.” Expected Output: “You can contact customer support anytime by visiting our ‘Contact Us’ page. You can reach us via email, phone, or live chat. If your inquiry is order-related, make sure to have your order number ready for quicker assistance. We’re here to help 24/7!” Use Case: Responding concisely to general customer queries.

Conclusion:
This experiment demonstrated that using diverse prompting methods greatly enhances the effectiveness of a customer service chatbot. Experiential prompts allowed for more human-like support interactions. Comparative prompts revealed the adaptability of machine-learning models over rule-based bots. Prompt size limitations helped deliver concise and effective responses in constrained environments. Collectively, these techniques empower MediGuide to offer intelligent, empathetic, and streamlined assistance to its users.

Result:
Thus, the prompts were designed and executed successfully. The chatbot MediGuide exhibited strong performance in managing a variety of customer queries using targeted and context-aware prompting strategies.
